# Welcome to the matching app of Tim de Roller
I am a student at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam and this is my matching app for Project Tech. 

The purpose of this app is that people who play a certain game can play it together with people without all the hassle with LFG sites and discords. No more KWTD and being ignored because you don't have a certain number of clears yet.

# About this App
To start up my server i can use `npm start` or `node server.js`, this will run the server on _localhost:5181_.

> I am still really busy with building the app, so more about this app is coming soon.

# The last things
